# Ideas

In Profile >Colors
+ Make support for color blind:
    + for example, red and green might be high contrast difference, but still low contrast for color blind :) :(
In Navigation
+ Make possible to navigate between pads even when pad is full-tab
    + we usually know where they are when zoomed-out
+ make a default command for each session
+ start the default command on opening session
